\section{Problem description}	

\paragraph{}
SIR-models (Susceptible, Infected, Removed/Recovered) are commonly used to model diseases in populations. In this report, we use a modified SIR-model called a HIZD-model (Human,Infected, Zombie, Decayed) to model a potential zombie apocalypse. The aim of the report is to determine the effect of some vital parameters, such as the infection risk when encountering a zombie, the incubation time for an infected human, on the survival of the human and zombie populations. In order to speed up the computation, the have used multi-threading and multi-core programming. We have run the simulation on an IBM iDataplex x86 system.

\section{Model}

\paragraph{}
The simulation takes place in the Northern Territory in Australia. In order to model this geographical area we use a 1500*1000 mesh where each square represents 1 km\textsuperscript{2}. Each square can be inhabited or empty. There are three types of inhabitants : \emph{humans}, \emph{infected} and \emph{zombies}. This is a sparsely populated area but it is the case in the Northern Territory where the density is only 0.17/km\textsuperscript{2}. In our model, the time granularity is days. 

In our model we have a number of variable factors, some relatively known and some unknown that can be changed to model different outcomes of the zombie apocalypse.

\subsection{Humans}
\paragraph{}
The initial population statistics of our humans were based  (table~\ref{AustralianData}).
\begin{table}[!h]
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
      \hline
        Density    & 0.17/km\textsuperscript{2} \\
      \hline
        Birth rate & 13.3 per year per 1000 persons \\
      \hline
        Death rate & 6.5 per year per 1000 persons \\
      \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Northern Territory demographic data}\label{AustralianData}
\end{table}

\paragraph{}
Most of the humans' daily moving are within a kilometer. In our simulation, the probability for a human to travel more than 1 kilometer in one day is 0.4. When a human encounters a zombie, it may become infected with the probability of 0.65.

\subsection{Zombies}
Zombies move slower than men. The probability for a zombie to travel more than 1 kilometer in one day is only 0.2. Zombies life is quite short : they decompose after about one months.

\subsection{Infected humans}
Infected humans become zombies after an incubation time of about 5 days. During the incubation period an infected cannot infect other humans. The behaviour of the infected is half-human, half-zombie : sometimes they move as quickly as humans, sometimes they are as slow as zombies. However, the power of the zombie virus during the incubation time is so powerful that infected humans cannot die like humans, or decomposed like zombies.




\section{Results}
%% TODO graphs !!!!!!!!!!!!!

%%% compare the evolution of the humans with and without the zombies
%%%     compare the population growth


%%% over the years, evolution of nb of humans, nb of zombies and infected
%%% per year (average) : number of infected
